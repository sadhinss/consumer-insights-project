## Project Overview

**Objective**: Analyze shopping behavior to uncover customer insights, purchasing trends, and promotional impacts using SQL and visualize the findings through a Tableau dashboard.

**Goal**: Develop SQL skills for business analytics by solving key questions related to customers, products, promotions, and satisfaction, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Data Analysis Queries (SQL)

A series of SQL queries were used to address the some analytics questions. Key highlights include:
- CTEs and subqueries to group, rank, and filter data.
- Aggregate functions like `AVG`, `COUNT`, `ROUND`, and conditional grouping with `CASE` statements.
- Analysis of seasonal trends, promo usage, and review ratings to identify actionable insights.
